This directory is to be filled with tiles for an open layer map.
The format is as follows:

x/y/z.png

where x is in between 0 and 7,
y and z are in between 0 and 2^(x-1)

So for level x=7, you need to have 65x65 tiles of the Chenarus map with the greatest zoom level (tiles with the greatest detail).
